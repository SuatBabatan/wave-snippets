# Wave Snippets Development Guide

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd packages/client
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

The server will start at http://localhost:3000

## Features Available Without Firebase

- Create and edit code snippets
- Add multiple steps to your snippets
- Choose from different themes and languages
- Preview your snippets

Note: Some features like authentication, saving snippets, and exporting to GIF/video will not work without Firebase configuration.

## Export Functionality Details

The export feature uses the following flow:

1. UI calls `/api/queue/media-export` endpoint with:
   - Snippet ID
   - Email addresses
   - Quality settings (low/medium/high)

2. Firebase Functions Process:
   - Uses Puppeteer (headless browser) to record snippet animation
   - Creates MP4 version (always)
   - Creates GIF version (unless high quality is selected)
   - Uploads files to Firebase Storage
   - Sends email with download links

### Local Development Requirements for Export

To implement export locally without Firebase, you would need:
1. Local Express server with:
   - `puppeteer` for browser automation
   - `ffmpeg` for video processing
   - `gif.js` or similar for GIF creation
2. Replace email delivery with direct file downloads

The main difference in local implementation would be immediate file downloads instead of email delivery.

# Wave Snippets Development Guide

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd packages/client
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

The server will start at http://localhost:3000

## Running with Firebase Emulators (Optional)

If you want to use Firebase features locally:

1. Switch to Node.js 18 for Firebase tools:
   ```bash
   use-firebase
   ```

2. Initialize Firebase emulators (first time only):
   ```bash
   firebase init emulators
   ```
   Select the following emulators:
   - Firestore Emulator
   - Storage Emulator
   - Functions Emulator (optional)

3. Start the Firebase emulators:
   ```bash
   firebase emulators:start
   ```

4. In a separate terminal, switch back to Node.js 10.21.0:
   ```bash
   nvm use 10.21.0
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd packages/client && yarn dev
   ```
